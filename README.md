I think everyone enjoys eating something delicious ;) To make things easier, weâ€™ve created an application that helps with making choices. Unfortunately, itâ€™s neither perfect nor complete. Below, youâ€™ll find three tasks that will help expand the appâ€™s functionality and perhaps also fix some bugs. Please place the task in a chosen code repository that we can access (e.g., GitHub). Ideally, present your solutions in the form of pull requests.

1. The main screen of the app features a list of chicken-based recipes. Please implement a detail view for each recipe. When a user selects a specific recipe, a new page should be displayed, showing a large image of the dish, its name, and step-by-step cooking instructions.
2. Currently, the MealsRepository retrieves data directly from network requests to populate the list of meals. To reduce dependency on constant network access, we would like to introduce a local database to serve as the primary data source for populating the views. The app should synchronize the database with the backend only when necessary, ensuring a smoother and more reliable user experience.
3. We recognize that this app is not perfect and would like to focus on making it better. Please assess the current implementation for any potential errors and areas that may require fixes or improvements.

The time allocated for the task is one and a half hours. Please make an initial commit when you start working.
Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
